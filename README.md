# Realm Rush
A grid-based tower defence game that uses BFS for enemy pathing.
Developed in Unity, coded fully in C#.

The enemies spawn in groups, and the pathing resets in groups, however if some of the group already passed the turning point to the new path, it recalculates a single use path of their own.
